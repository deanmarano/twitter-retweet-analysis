== Twitter Retweet Analysis

For a final project for my DePaul Social Networking class, I'm taking a
look at the Twitterverse to see how retweets happen, who is retweeted the most,
and how retweet frequency corresponds to the number of followers.

This project, although a Rails app, will mainly be used for rake tasks. I'm
using Rails for ActiveRecord to store tweets in the database, and have a cron
job that pulls in new tweets every hour. I will also have a function that generates
an XML file to be used with Gephi, in GEXF (Graph Exchange XML Format).
